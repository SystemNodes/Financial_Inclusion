# Financial Inclusion in Africa: Task Details and Business Understanding

*Task:*

Using a dataset containing demographic and financial service usage information for individuals in East Africa, the objective is to train a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of an individual having or using a bank account. The model will output a binary classification, indicating whether an individual is likely or unlikely to have/use a bank account.

*Problem Statement:*

Financial inclusion is a critical factor for economic development in Africa. By enabling individuals to access and utilize formal financial services like bank accounts, financial inclusion can improve saving habits, facilitate access to credit, and empower individuals to participate more fully in the economy.

This project focuses on building a model to predict bank account ownership in East Africa. This model can be used for:

- Identifying individuals who would benefit most from financial inclusion initiatives.
- Optimizing marketing campaigns for banking products and services.
- Understanding the factors influencing financial inclusion in the region.

*Business Understanding:*

Financial institutions like banks and microfinance providers can leverage this model to:

- Target unbanked populations: The model can identify individuals who are most likely to be unbanked based on their demographic profiles. Banks can then develop targeted marketing campaigns and financial products tailored to this segment.

- Reduce risk: By understanding the characteristics associated with bank account ownership, banks can better assess the creditworthiness of potential borrowers and reduce the risk of loan defaults.

- Improve financial literacy: The model can be used to identify areas where financial literacy programs are most needed. By understanding the factors that prevent individuals from accessing bank accounts, policymakers can design more effective financial education initiatives.
